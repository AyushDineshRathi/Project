# Machine Learning Journey 🚀

**This repository is a living collection of my work in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, and Generative AI.** Instead of being a fixed project archive, this repo grows continuously as I learn new concepts, build experiments, and implement ideas from scratch.

It represents a hands‑on learning journey — from core algorithms to advanced deep learning and real‑world applications.

---

## What this repository is about

- **Practical implementations** of ML, DL, and NLP concepts
- **Small experiments, mini-projects, and full applications**
- **Implementations from scratch** to understand core logic
- **End-to-end projects** with training, evaluation, and deployment
- **Continuous additions** as new topics are explored

> This is not a static portfolio — it is an evolving technical notebook of progress.

## Philosophy

**Learn → Implement → Experiment → Improve → Repeat**

Each project is an opportunity to deepen understanding and iterate on ideas. Some experiments are intentionally rough — learning is the focus.

---

## Future additions
- Transformer-based applications
- Multimodal AI systems
- Real-time ML deployments
- Research-inspired implementations and end-to-end AI products
