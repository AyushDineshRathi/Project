## Introduction: 
Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. Early prediction of heart disease can help in taking preventive measures and improving patient outcomes. This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the presence of heart disease based on various medical attributes.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Heart Disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 303 instances with 14 attributes, including age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, oldpeak, slope, number of major vessels, thal, and the target variable indicating the presence of heart disease.

## Models:
The following machine learning models were used in this project:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- AdaBoost Classifier
- Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier

## Results
The performance of the models was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The model is made using the Random Forest classifier with 84% accuracy.
